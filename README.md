# Automated Scientific Discovery System

This repository contains a simplified implementation of an automated scientific discovery system. The system goes through a series of steps to generate, validate, and accumulate hypotheses based on thought experiments.

## System Components

### 1. Hypothesis Generation (`HypothesisGenerator`)

The `HypothesisGenerator` class is responsible for generating hypotheses based on provided thought experiments. It uses natural language understanding and reasoning to propose hypotheses.

### 2. Hypothesis Validation Component (`HypothesisValidator`)

The `HypothesisValidator` class validates hypotheses by running experiments or simulations. It checks the validity of the hypotheses and collects those that pass the validation criteria.

### 3. Recursive Loop (`ScientificDiscoverySystem`)

The `ScientificDiscoverySystem` class coordinates the discovery process. It iteratively generates hypotheses and validates them, accumulating the validated hypotheses in each iteration.

### 4. Feedback Mechanism (`FeedbackMechanism`)

The `FeedbackMechanism` class provides a way to learn from the results. In practice, feedback mechanisms are crucial for improving the hypothesis generation and validation processes.

### 5. Continuous Learning (`ContinuousLearning`)

The `ContinuousLearning` class aims to adapt the system to new information and research. It is essential for keeping the system up-to-date with the latest knowledge.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example Usage
generator = HypothesisGenerator()
validator = HypothesisValidator()
system = ScientificDiscoverySystem(generator, validator)
thought_experiments = ["Experiment 1", "Experiment 2"]
iterations = 3

discovered_hypotheses = system.discover(thought_experiments, iterations)
print("Discovered Hypotheses:", discovered_hypotheses)
